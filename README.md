### Must-have features

_A form with different input fields :_

- image,
- name,
- age,
- animal species,
- animal class
- favourite food

**Error reporting, give some visual feedback to the user if they put something wrong in the inputs.**

**Form validation**

**An animal list, do this by sending a GET request to your local node server and save the data.**

**A POST request to add a animal to our animal data base.**
